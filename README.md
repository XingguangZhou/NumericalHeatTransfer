###This repo is my NHT/CHT/CFD program pratice of the NHT class which is taught by Professor Wen-quan Tao.
1. Final Home Work is a 2D engineering problem solve by the program, in this directory, the Main.F is the SIMPLER algorithm solver which made by Professor Tao, and the CASEA.F90, CASEB.F90 is written by myself to initialize the whole field, set the boundary conditions, modeling the solid and fluid region.
2. The other directory such as FirstOiderUpwind and TDMA+FVM is the self-program of the usual homework.
3. All the program is based on the Finite Volume Method(FVM) and Spatial Discrete Method B.
